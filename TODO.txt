* switch cluster with specific command (current connect? find a new name? similar to what use does in mongodb shell)
it means setting a default object (es?) available in the context
* allow for connecting to multiple clusters within the same shell (as the mongodb-shell)
* allow for choosing between transportclient (sniff) and nodeclient
* how to make available default queries
* make builders available?
* how to expose operations? just a bunch of methods in client object?
* how to expose methods with many indexes and many types? builder?
need to do what es does internally to generate objects from url (can I use . as separator? allow to escape it?)
need to parse command again and decide whether its an index, a type or nothing
* make client object available in the shell?
* auto completion (the mongodb shell auto completes even within a json object!!!!)
* index.type.command
* test!!!!!!!!
* connect on startup
* close nodes and clients on shutdown
* message with indexes and types available
* default java imports
* platform problems troubleshooting (http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Shell) vs. silent disable JLine if fails
* start message
* help message / usage
* help specific for every command
* package scanning for commands
* save history to file (max size?)
* ctrl+c hook
* colours
* jansi fusesource for windows ansi


* README file (mention rhino & JLine)

* open file? run command? (Rhino shell vs. mongo shell vs. groovy shell)
